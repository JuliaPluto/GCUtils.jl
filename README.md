# GCUtils.jl

Utility to automatically schedule GC work to long running julia processes.

## How to use:

```julia
import GCUtils: setup_gc

# ...

after, cleanup, metrics = setup_gc()

HTTP.serve!() do ()

    # Add this after work is done, i.e. in a server. `after` is lightweight (atomically sets two values)
    after()
end

@info "Metrics: " metrics
cleanup()

```
